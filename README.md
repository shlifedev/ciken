This is my C# utility for reading the memory of a target process with a direct memory access attack. It will support interface extensions to make it easy to extend for different game engines, different games.


I'm taking inspiration from open sources in various communities and modifying them in my own way. 
The following features will be added

- A very nice looking Drawing Utility (Renderer)
- Extensible public interface
- 3D/2D Render Tester for Game Engines.
